#### Project Status
As of 27/06/2023, the SwapSync project is currently in a partially integrated state. The smart contract has been developed and thoroughly tested, while the front-end interface has been completed separately. Due to time constraints, the integration of the smart contract and front-end components has not been finalized.


#### How To Clone and Use The Project
* Clone the project by running the command
 ```
 git clone https://github.com/olaoyesalem/SwapSync____Axelar.git
```
* Install the dependencies by running the command
```
 npm i

#### SwapSync Interaction Flow
The following steps outline the interaction flow within the SwapSync platform:

* User A visits SwapSync and creates an offer, specifying the token they have and the token they want to swap. This offer is displayed in the offer section of the platform.
* User B discovers User A's offer on SwapSync and decides to accept it.
* User A receives an email notification confirming that their offer has been accepted. The notification includes details about the accepting user (User B) and the tokens involved in the swap.
* User A returns to SwapSync and proceeds with the swap transaction, utilizing the smart contract to facilitate the token exchange.
* The swap is executed, transferring the specified amount of tokens from User A to User B, and vice versa.
* Both User A and User B receive a confirmation of the successful swap.
<br>
Please note that the above flow assumes the successful integration of the smart contract and front-end interface, which is currently under development and not finalized in this repository.

#### Smart Contract
To use the smart contract, follow these steps:
This use case 
assumes that a user A wants 1 matic and has 2 Avax up for grabs.
It also assumes User A has created the  offer above .
It also assumes that User B has accepted User A's offer.

* **Step 1**: Go to the contract folder and deploy the smart contract.
* **Step 2**: User B sends native token to the smart contract of swap sync of the desired chain(e.g. User B sneds matic to Polygon chain ).
* **Step 3**: User A sends his token(the one he wants to swap) to user B, pays for gas simulteneously sending a struct to  the smart contract on the polygon chain to send User A's token(the token sent by User B to the polygon smart contract) to User A's address using axelar's GMP by calling this function
  ```
  function sendMessage(address   _to,uint256 amountToRecieve, string calldata destinationChain, string calldata destinationAddress)external payable   {}

  ```

* **Step 4**:Swap is complete!  

Please note that the integration step between the smart contract and the front-end interface is not currently included in the setup instructions. However, you can still run and test each component individually.

#### Positive experiences of learning and using Axelar:
**I experienced expanded interoperability for my dApps**: With Axelar, I was able to build decentralized applications (dApps) that seamlessly interacted with multiple blockchain networks. This empowered me to create innovative solution that leveraged the functionalities and assets from various chains(which is a key part to the creation of SwapSync). Axelar's cross-chain communication capabilities allowed me to provide a comprehensive user experience, which will enable my users to effortlessly interact with different chains and access a wide range of applications and assets with just a single click.

**I trusted in the security and stability of Axelar**: Axelar's use of the proven proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, employed by reputable blockchain networks like Ethereum, Polygon, and Cosmos, gave me confidence in the security and stability of my cross-chain transactions. Building on PoS, Axelar ensured a robust and secure environment for my interchain applications. This allowed me to focus on building innovative solutions without compromising the safety and integrity of my users' transactions.
